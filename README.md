Website for a future business idea. This is meant to stretch my ability to learn and is a large undertaking. I have installed Material, Tailwind, Express, and Pug so far.

Notes for website so far:

IT WILL NOT RUN ON EXPRESS CURRENTLY. I need to fix the pathing. In order to run, I learned about several plugins and the format can currently be checked using Live Server. Do not attempt to run on Localhost 5000 or it WILL throw an error.

Notes to run the service:
    - You can use the command: npx tailwindcss -i ./public/css/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch creates output.css
    - You can use the command: npx tailwindcss -i ./public/css/input.css -o ./dist/styles.css --watch to run a different stlyesheet name
    - Install Live Server plugin


To actually start the preview use: "npm run dev" then select Run Live Server.
